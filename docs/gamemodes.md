Game modes
==========

There are several classes of game modes.


MARATHON
--------

Modes in which the goal is to play as well as possible over a limited game interval, to ultimately achieve the title of Grand Master.

* **MARATHON 2020**: 2020 levels of pure pain. Can you make it all the way?

From other games:
* **MARATHON A1**: Tetris the Grand Master 1.
* **MARATHON A2**: Tetris the Grand Master 2 (TAP Master).
* **MARATHON A3**: Tetris the Grand Master 3 (no exams).


SURVIVAL
--------

Modes that concentrate on how long you can survive an increasingly fast and difficult game.

* **SURVIVAL 2020**: It only gets worse. Beware of bone blocks!

From other games:
* **SURVIVAL A1**: 20G mode from Tetris the Grand Master.
* **SURVIVAL A2**: T.A. Death.
* **SURVIVAL A3**: Ti Shirase.

PHANTOM
--------

Variants of Survival modes in which everything is the same, but everything is invisible.

* **PHANTOM MANIA**: Based on Survival A2.
* **PHANTOM MANIA 2**: Based on Survival A3. Probably impossible.
* **PHANTOM MANIA M**: (TODO: Add information about this)

OTHER
--------
These are miscellaneous modes that don't really fit into any other category.

**DEMON MODE**: So hard, even TASers meet a challenge.

**STRATEGY**: The lock delay is insanely short, so you better think fast.

**INTERVAL TRAINING**: After 30 seconds of intense gameplay, you get a break. Rinse and repeat.

**THE TETRISGRAM<sup>TM</sup> PACER TEST**: It's literally just the FitnessGram Pacer Test in the form of a Tetris mode.

**LIGNE**: Sprint mode; clear 40 lines as fast as possible. To be renamed in an update.

(TODO: Find out what a Line Attack is)
